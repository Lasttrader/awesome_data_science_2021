avoid provoking voter anger,” says Alexei Makarkin, deputy director of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow-based research organization. Times are hard, and that’s bolstering anti-immigrant sentiment.\n","\n","0820P_ECON_RUSSIA_02\n","Foreign-born residents wait to complete paperwork at Moscow’s Multifunctional Migration Center on Dec. 6, 2019.PHOTOGRAPHER: ARTYOM GEODAKYAN/TASS/ZUMA PRESS\n","Just two years ago, Putin boasted at his annual end-of-year press conference that his government had managed to reverse the demographic slump triggered by the collapse of the Soviet Union. But in last month’s state-of-the-nation speech he warned of a fresh population crisis. “We have entered a very difficult demographic period,” he said, unveiling a series of new benefits for families to encourage them to have more children. “Russia’s future, her historical prospects, depend on how many of us there are.”\n","\n","In 2018, as the flow of migrants fell to its lowest point in 13 years, Russia’s population recorded its first dip since 2008—a decline that continued last year. By 2050, according to Russian and United Nations forecasts, the nation will have 10 million fewer inhabitants than its current 146 million.\n","\n","Russia net migration\n","\n","As part of Putin’s campaign to raise life expectancy to 80 years by 2030, Russia has made huge strides in tackling the causes of its high death rate. Sales restrictions slashed alcohol consumption by 43% from 2003 to 2016, while excise taxes and other measures have driven down tobacco use by more than 20% in just seven years. The measures have raised life expectancy to more than 73 years, from a low of 65 soon after Putin came to power.\n","\n","The government has had less success in boosting the birthrate, which plunged to 1.2 births per woman at one point in the 1990s, which is why the country now suffers a shortage of women of childbearing age. At 1.5 births per woman, Russia’s fertility rate is now comparable to that of Western European nations, but remains below the so-called replacement rate needed to keep the population stable.\n","\n","“Migration should be the top priority,” says Anatoly Vishnevsky, director of the Institute of Demography at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Yet the foreign-born population is barely growing: It was 12 million in 2019 (equal to 8% of the total), the same as in 2000, according to United Nations estimates. In the U.S. the foreign-born population rose from 35 million to 51 million over the same period.\n","\n","The demographic situation could be “turned around if the authorities didn’t worry about a backlash,” Vishnevsky says. In an interview with the Financial Times last year, Putin slammed German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to admit more than a million refugees in 2015, mostly from war-torn Syria, as a “cardinal mistake.” He also said he understood Trump’s campaign pledge to build a wall between Mexico and the U.S. The influx of migrants from Central Asia provokes “irritation among the local population” because of cultural differences, Putin said at a press conference in December.\n","\n","During a meeting with human-rights activists in 2013, Putin bluntly stated his views on what kind of migrants he would like to see. Svetlana Gannushkina, a leading campaigner for immigrant rights, says Putin told her in a private exchange that Russia needs “people of Slavic appearance, of reproductive age, and with a good education.” That describes the people leaving, not those coming to Russia, says Gannushkina. Up to 2 million Russians have emigrated since 2000, according to a study released last year by the Washington-based Atlantic Council.\n","\n","The government has tried to lure the 30 million native Russian speakers living outside the country’s borders with incentives that include fast-track citizenship approvals. Yet despite an influx of Ukrainians fleeing the conflict in 2014 between pro-Russian separatists and the Kiev government, less than a million so-called compatriots have accepted Moscow’s invitation of resettlement in the past dozen years. That number doesn’t include 227,000 inhabitants of eastern Ukraine who took up an offer of Russian citizenship in 2019 but may not actually move to Russia.\n","\n","0820P_ECON_RUSSIA_03]"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mzm9NhHX-4Cq","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Разделение текстов на предложение\n","\n","sentences = []\n","for i in data['content']:\n","  sentences.append(sent_tokenize(i))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"CQ-gbsddinZ0","colab_type":"code","outputId":"08f3b85c-190b-401c-d497-3317c1cbb4f9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1570876867754,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":1092,"user":{"displayName":"Grigoriy Sokolov","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCMjQ30xEkpH2PQkqsBJWqak7z5JAkwPSBbqNyD5Cg=s64","userId":"08935654732606601294"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":436}},"source":["# проверим предложения\n","sentences[0:10]"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[['LOS ANGELES Robert Forster, the handsome and omnipresent character actor who got a career resurgence and Oscar nomination for playing bail bondsman Max Cherry in Jackie Brown, died Friday.',\n","  'He was 78.',\n","  'Publicist Kathie Berlin said Forster died of brain cancer … [+4087 chars]'],\n"," ['What the event lacked in officially sanctioned gravitas it seemed determined to make up for with theater and grandiose proclamations.',\n","  'The run, organized by the petrochemical company INEOS, featured a cycle of hype and commercial buildup more reminiscent of a… [+620 chars]'],\n"," ['As Hagibis approached this week at one point the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane, with 160 m.p.h.',\n","  'winds the Japanese authorities prepared for disruptions in the lives of millions.',\n","  'About 1.5 million people live below sea level in eastern parts of Tokyo, a… [+1361 chars]'],\n"," ['Despite the official announcement being on Tuesday, Best Buy in Canada has already listed the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL for pre-order.',\n","  'A dedicated product page notes the key features and specs, while also allowing buyers to place a deposit.',\n","  'The official marketi… [+2156 chars]'],\n"," ['Gov.',\n","  'Gavin Newsom on Friday did what two of his predecessors refused to do: He prohibited smoking and vaping in most areas of California state parks and beaches.',\n","  'People caught using cigarettes, cigars, pipes or electronic cigarettes will face a fine of up to… [+2965 chars]'],\n"," ['Share this article\\r\\nCompanies in this article\\r\\nBlizzard\\r\\nOn Friday evening, Blizzard Entertainment president J.
